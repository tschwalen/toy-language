# toy-language
A very simple implementation of a very simple "language". I just wanted to try my hand at trying to implement something like this using intuition.
Right now it has a movable "infinite" tape that you can read and write to. I haven't added any registers or arithemetic operations,
so it doesn't do anything very intersting yet but that's subject to change. At least it can print out "Hello World!".

I plan to add some form of loops, conditionals, gotos/jump statements, and registers to store and compare values. Essentially,
I would like it to be turing complete.
